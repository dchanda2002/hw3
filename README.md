### Parts 1 and 2 ###

For parts 1 and 2, the testing code is located in llrec-test.cpp,
which can be run using ```make``` or ```make llrec-test```

Different parts of the code in llrec-test.cpp can be commented
or uncommented depending on whether llpivot or llfilter is to be tested.
Currently, the code to test llfilter is uncommented - but this can be edited
by the user before running the ```make```.

### Part 3 ###

For part 3, the testing code is located in stack-test.cpp,
which can be run using ```make stack-test```

### Part 4 ###

The pdf has the answers.

### Parts 5 and 6 ###

No testing code is added by me, so run ```make``` using instructions
from the codio assignment.
